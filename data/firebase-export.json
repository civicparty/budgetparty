Gondolas are typically used for short trips (usually 1-2 miles) or in very difficult terrain where other transit modes struggle to provide service, like steep inclines or water crossings. Gondolas are also found in areas where a private developer has partnered (read: paid) to put the system in place. The Portland Aerial Tram and Oregon Health & Science University services were developed through partnerships, for example. Gondolas provide great views above the hustle-and-bustle of everyday life but cannot carry many people per car, don’t feature air conditioning, and typically move at the same pace as an average bicycle. For these reasons, this mode does not qualify for high-capacity transit investment. \n \n The Federal Transit Administration has never funded a gondola project. Furthermore, a recent study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute revealed that gondola service, paid for solely by Capital Metro, is not a viable mode for the agency to add to their transit mix. Though gondolas certainly align with the “keep Austin weird” vibe, a private company or developer would have to fund gondolas in our city.",

If traffic is congested, however, a rapid bus has limited ways to get out of it. A rapid bus may have a special bus-only lane to pass traffic, like on Guadalupe and Lavaca streets downtown, but those lanes are just a small part of the overall route. Rapid buses must still share those lanes with turning cars. Rapid buses may be able to change signal timing at traffic lights to get a jump start over other vehicles, but this feature is only included at a handful of locations along a route. Even though rapid buses move a lot people, this mode isn’t considered high-capacity transit because it doesn’t operate in its own dedicated lane for most of a route. In short, rapid buses are one step below true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, and BRT is considered high-capacity transit. \n \n MetroRapid is still an important part of Capital Metro’s service fleet though it isn’t considered a mode option for Project Connect’s new corridor investment projects. Instead, MetroRapid will benefit from more priority lanes and intersection improvements as part of Project Connect’s enhancement projects. The MetroRapid system will also be upgraded with new routes and stations as part of Capital Metro’s Connections 2025 plan. ",

If traffic is congested, however, a rapid bus has limited ways to get out of it. A rapid bus may have a special bus-only lane to pass traffic, like on Guadalupe and Lavaca streets downtown, but those lanes are just a small part of the overall route. Rapid buses must still share those lanes with turning cars. Rapid buses may be able to change signal timing at traffic lights to get a jump start over other vehicles, but this feature is only included at a handful of locations along a route. Even though rapid buses move a lot people, this mode isn’t considered high-capacity transit because it doesn’t operate in its own dedicated lane for most of a route. In short, rapid buses are one step below true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, and BRT is considered high-capacity transit. \n \n MetroRapid is still an important part of Capital Metro’s service fleet though it isn’t considered a mode option for Project Connect’s new corridor investment projects. Instead, MetroRapid will benefit from more priority lanes and intersection improvements as part of Project Connect’s enhancement projects. The MetroRapid system will also be upgraded with new routes and stations as part of Capital Metro’s Connections 2025 plan. ",

Gondolas are typically used for short trips (usually 1-2 miles) or in very difficult terrain where other transit modes struggle to provide service, like steep inclines or water crossings. Gondolas are also found in areas where a private developer has partnered (read: paid) to put the system in place. The Portland Aerial Tram and Oregon Health & Science University services were developed through partnerships, for example. Gondolas provide great views above the hustle-and-bustle of everyday life but cannot carry many people per car, don’t feature air conditioning, and typically move at the same pace as an average bicycle. For these reasons, this mode does not qualify for high-capacity transit investment. \n \n The Federal Transit Administration has never funded a gondola project. Furthermore, a recent study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute revealed that gondola service, paid for solely by Capital Metro, is not a viable mode for the agency to add to their transit mix. Though gondolas certainly align with the “keep Austin weird” vibe, a private company or developer would have to fund gondolas in our city.",
