## Hackathon Task 
[These are issues](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AATXHack4Change) we've decided to focus on for the ATX Hack for Change weekend.

To provide some more context, here is a high level overview of what we are focused on next:

### 📃 ➡️ 💻 Turn the curriculum (which is a PDF right now) into a website.
- [Designers & HTML/CSS Coders needed to liberate curriculum from PDF](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/128)

### 🔍 🗺️ Create a District Profile Lookup tool

- [Data viz designers & developers needed to create a District Profile tool](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/80)
- This would be for students/citizens to view demographic breakdowns of each City Council district and look up who their Councilmember is.

###  💰📊 Add Budget Data Visualizations
- Data viz designers & developers needed to incorporate a pie chart or another useful visualizations that allow you to see what percentage of the City's General Fund is going to each department. Figure out how this fits into the existing flow of the app. [Issue #136](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/136)

### 🏙️ 🎉 Make Budget Party work for other cities
- Researchers, policy wonks, and software architectues needed to start research budgets in other cities and start abstracting out the City specific logic and moving city specific details into easily editable config files. [Issue #135](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/135)

### 💅 🐛 Polish up the budget party app by reporting bugs, fixing bugs, adding enhancements.
1. 🔥 🗄️ Firebase is our backend system for authentication and NoSQL database services. We need to do a couple things to make our React/Redux app play more nicely with Firebase.

  - [🗝️ Update Anonoymous Auth to the Firebase way](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/132)

2. [🐛 Bugs](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
3. [✍️ Policy Research/Writers needed to look up and update budget numbers](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/134)
