    desc: "Launched in 2014 as MetroRapid, bus rapid transit (BRT) offers more frequent service with more amenities, like free onboard Wi-Fi, providing an attractive alternative to driving cars. It operates in mixed traffic or in transit-only lanes through downtown on Guadalupe and Lavaca Streets between MLK and Cesar Chavez. Special technology allows MetroRapid vehicles to catch more green lights to stay on schedule.",

    desc: "Unlike light-rail or heavy-rail systems, which tend to focus on serving a larger number of passengers over longer distances, the modern streetcar vehicle is smaller and typically runs a length of 3 to 5 miles. Due to its scale, the modern streetcar is more pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly, the implementation cost is considerably lower, and the required infrastructure can more easily be implemented on regular streets.",

    type: "Light Rail (LRT)",
    desc: "The primary advantage of light-rail transit is its adaptability, both in terms of the variety of environments it can operate in and its ability to add passenger capacity. Light rail is mostly operated in denser, more centralized, more walkable areas of a city where there is no free parking. Light rail can operate and cross roadways at street level mainly along dedicated rights-of-way, or it can operate in a totally separate guideway, either elevated or underground. Light rail can also quickly add passenger capacity, accommodating up to 10 times the number of riders as a bus.",
